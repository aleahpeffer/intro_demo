Load the dplyr and ggplot2 packages for data wrangling and visualization, respectively. 

```{r}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

Load data from Duke stats website. Assign the object the name "Gapminder"

```{r}
gapminder <- read.csv("https://stat.duke.edu/~mc301/data/gapminder.csv")
```

Create a new object called gap07. Take the gapminder data set, "pipe" (%>%) it into your code. Then, filter data for 2007. 

```{r}
gap07 <- gapminder %>% 
  filter(year==2007)

```

Plot gapminder data from 2007:

```{r}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, data = gap07)
```

Add color to the plot of 2007 data:

```{r}
qplot(x = gdpPercap, y = lifeExp, color = continent, data = gap07)
```
